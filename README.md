# Nummy

## Overview

An universal calculator inspired by [Numi](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi)

Handling of dimensions and units is inspired by the [`units` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/units)

## Usage

Nummy is designed to compute and convert different values in a human-readable format

Generally any query line looks like `expression in format`

### Physical units

You can compute an arithmetic expression of units and present them in another unit you prefer.

```
> 3ft in m
0.9144 m

> 60 km/h + 3 m/s
70.8 km/h

> 3 m^2 - 1ft^2 in mm^2
2907096.96 mmÂ²
```
